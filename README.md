# PortfolioV1

Prototyping portfolio.
Main principle was NOT to use any modern conventions (BEM, Sass) as a training. Pure CSS with combinators, vanilla JS.
But why?! To gain practice in dealing with problems it creates (i.e. css conflicts), to practice combinators, to have a direct and practical comparison how working with/without them looks like - simply to test it out on my own and to reach my own conclusions.
Next step is to rebuild this site with the usage of BEM and Sass.
